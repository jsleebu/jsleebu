For part 1, it was easy because it is basic and I learned it before. 
However, it was a little hard to understand the questions in part 2. 
After I asked some questions to Professor Burstein and TA, I understood them and I think I did well. 
For part 3, this is my first time using Git and GitHub and I was confused at first because I am not used to it.
